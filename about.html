            <p>I was born in Olympia, WA and lived there for the first 18 years of my life.  After dropping out of high school I attended The Art Institute of Seattle eventually graduating with my associates degree in audio production.  I then proceeded to bounce around from odd job to odd job. At this time I still had very lofty dreams.</p>

            <p>Growing tired of where I was and feeling like I could have a grand adventure, I decided to join The United States Army.  Two months after graduating basic training, I was deployed to Iraq to assist in helping them hold their elections.  After another deployment to Afghanistan, I decided it was time for a new adventure in life.</p>

            <p>Since my return back to Washington, I have completed my bachelor's degree in audio production and am now pursuing my interests in coding.  I am looking forward to seeing where this next chapter in my life takes me!</p>
